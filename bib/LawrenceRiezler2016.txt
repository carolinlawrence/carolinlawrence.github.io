  abstract  = {We present a Natural Language Interface (nlmaps.cl.uni-heidelberg.de) to query
	OpenStreetMap. Natural language questions about geographical facts are parsed
	into database queries that can be executed against the OpenStreetMap (OSM)
	database. After parsing the question, the system provides a text based answer
	as well as an interactive map with all points of interest and their relevant
	information marked. Additionally, we provide several options for users to give
	feedback after a question has been parsed.},
