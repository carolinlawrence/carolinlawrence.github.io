I am a research scientist in the Machine Learning group of NEC Labs Europe. I work on natural language processing (NLP), graph structured data and making machine-learnt models more interpretabe. Together with colleagues, I have recently developed a method for bidirectional sequence generation (BiSon), which we have for example applied to improve dialogue generation for chat bots.

From 2014-2018 I was graduate research assistant and PhD student at the Statistical NLP group at the Heidelberg University, supervised by Prof. Dr. Stefan Riezler. During my PhD I worked on Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, such as machine translation and question-answering, and I explored how reinforcement learning can be applied to these problems.

# Research Interests
* Machine Learning, particularly for Graph-structured Data and using Reinforcement Learning
* Natural Language Processing, particularly Question-Answering and Dialogue
* Explainable AI
