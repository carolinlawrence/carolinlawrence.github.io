I am a research scientist in the Machine Learning group of NEC Labs Europe. I work on natural language processing (NLP), graph structured data and making machine-learnt models more interpretable.

From 2014-2018 I was graduate research assistant and PhD student at the Statistical NLP group at the Heidelberg University, supervised by Prof. Dr. Stefan Riezler. During my PhD I worked on Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, such as machine translation and question-answering, and I explored how reinforcement learning can be applied to these problems.

## Research Interests
* Machine Learning, particularly for Graph-structured Data and using Reinforcement Learning
* Explainable AI: AI should enrich our lives and for this we should work on interpretable, trustworthy and inclusive AI
* Natural Language Processing, particularly Question-Answering and Dialogue

Recently, colleagues and I have developed a method to explain the prediction of neural matrix factorization models, which are used for knowledge base completion and recommender systems. You can check out a related talk here:
